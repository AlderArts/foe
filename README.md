#Fall of Eden

## Status
Fall of Eden (or FoE) is currently in alpha stage.

## Building
The game can be played right off the bat by opening foe_debug.html. There is also a building process using google closure compiler. This creates a more streamlined version, deposited in the folder build/

The build process uses Node.js and gulp. You need to install gulp-cli globally with npm and gulp, gulp-clean, gulp-closure-compiler locally to your project directory.
