 WRITING IDEAS
---------------


* Gwendy's farm
 - Restoration initiative
 
 - Trade post
  + Brothel

 - Breeding season
  + Help out, breed the cows
  + Help out, relieve the bulls
 - Gwendy and Adrian's romance
  + Nudge them into a relationship
  + Dom/Sub balance in relationship
  + Horse morph item
   - Turns Adrian into hulk, or
   - Turns Gwendy into herm
   - Another dose (later) turn her into shemale?

----------------------
 MAIN STORYLINE IDEAS
----------------------

* The surface


* Eden
 - Floating island where the fabric of reality is thin
  + easier to open portals to/from here
 - Island floats due to the big tree at its center
 - Inhabited by many races
 
 - Edens underbelly
  + A hidden large demon citadel inside/underneath the island
  + Can be accessed through dragon, desert nomads or subterranian tunnels



* Alliser
 - The "old man"
 - Known as a reclusive sage in the land of Eden
 - A magician/alchemist with knowledge of the planes
 - Important to the endgame



* Jeanne
 - Female mage at the kings court
 - Skilled in many fields of magic
 - Dabbling alchemist
  + Weird and dangerous formulas
 - Knows of Alliser



* Planes concept
 - For example, Light/Dark aspect
 - Other dimensions with different rules
  + Time/space works differently
 - Portals can be opened between the planes (with great difficulty)
 - Once you know the rules of a plane, your powers there will increase manifold
 
 - Different planes for extra fun?
  + Underwater world
  + Giant world
   - Player is tiny in comparison to everything else
   - Hyper TFs?
  + Goo world



* Uru, demon omnibus
 - Ruler of the dark aspect
 - Vily, horny
 - Seeks conquest of Eden, and as many planes as she can



* Aria, angelic being (female)
 - Ruler of the light aspect
 - Serene
 - Seeks to prevent Uru's plans
 - Agenda to close off the planes?



* The dragons
 - Syliztraxia, the queen, herm
