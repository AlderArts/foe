TODO:
-----
* Combat status effects
* Persistent status effects




IDEAS:
------

Orgasm/Load/Preg code

TODO:
* Look through Lactation code, there is something wrong with it (TEST)
* Preg stuff:
 - Slots
 - StomachDesc
 - Counter

* Burrows writing
 - Lagon. Vena. Ophelia.
 - Mob scenes.
 - Orgy scene.

* Miranda writing
 - the kids talk
 - More dating variations
 - More subby sex
 - Super dommy in nice mode

* Minigame framework (use for Pit, Miranda dungeon, possibly others)
 - Use the three stats, hp, sp, lust (equivalent of will/stamina/lust)
 - Use the regular values, and use fractional increases?
 - Stamina(sp) depletes over time and with exhertion. Can be restored with food/rest.
 - Lust increases over time and by teasing. Depleted by orgasm.
 - Will(hp) is your lifebar. Decreases when you are broken down. Goes down quicker if you're out of stamina or full on lust.
 - When you run out of will, you reach the minigame failstate.
 - While doing the minigame, you have very limited options, and are confined to a single location.
  + Each action takes up a block of time.
 - There may be other partymembers or entities involved in the minigame, with similar stats.
  + Short interactions with the others, dependant on their will/stamina/lust values.
  + Example, Kiai is captured and locked in with you in Miranda's dungeon. Talking with them will raise both your will values a little.
 - The win state is endurance (or escape).
 - What happens if follower reaches 0 will? Broken state?

 MAIN STORYLINE IDEAS
----------------------

* Eden
 - Floating island where the fabric of reality is thin
  + easier to open portals to/from here
 - Island floats due to the big tree at its center
 - Inhabited by many races
 
 - Edens underbelly
  + A hidden large demon citadel inside/underneath the island
  + Can be accessed through dragon, desert nomads or subterranian tunnels


* Alliser
 - The "old man"
 - Known as a reclusive sage in the land of Eden
 - A magician/alchemist with knowledge of the planes
 - Important to the endgame


* Jeanne
 - Female mage at the kings court
 - Skilled in many fields of magic
 - Dabbling alchemist
  + Weird and dangerous formulas
 - Knows of Alliser


* Planes concept
 - For example, Light/Dark aspect
 - Other dimensions with different rules
  + Time/space works differently
 - Portals can be opened between the planes (with great difficulty)
 - Once you know the rules of a plane, your powers there will increase manifold
 
 - Different planes for extra fun?
  + Desert world
  + Underwater world
  + Giant world
   - Player is tiny in comparison to everything else
   - Hyper TFs?
  + Goo world


* Uru, demon omnibus
 - Ruler of the dark aspect
 - Vily, horny
 - Seeks conquest of Eden, and as many planes as she can


* Aria, angelic being (female)
 - Ruler of the light aspect
 - Serene
 - Seeks to prevent Uru's plans
 - Agenda to close off the planes?


* The dragons
 - Syliztraxia, the queen, herm
