You find further evidence of the caravan; splinters of wood and patches of cloth hanging off scraggly trees. Some of the narrow sections you pass through doesn’t look like they’d even allow for a regular wagon to pass through. It’s as if someone hauled it through bodily. It’s not a feat possible for a regular horse, far less by mere bandits.

				More alarming, you begin to see unnatural secretions of… something. Sticky mucus clings to the cliffside like an infestation of some sort. It’s not spiderwebs, but perhaps something similar. Surely, it’s not natural. Trying not to touch it, you soldier on.

				Rounding a corner, you come upon a secluded valley in the hill; a place of madness and corruption. The strange sticky mucus is everywhere, and there is an unnerving whirring noise, like that of the distant rapid beat of insect wings. Even looking around, you can’t figure out its source - it’s as if it was emanating from the inside of your skull.

				Here, you finally discover the fate of the unlucky caravan: the remains of several wagons smashed to pieces and scattered across the ground. You quickly realize that you’re not alone, however, as there is a large hulking shape rummaging through the remains of one of the carts. Half woman, half insect, all terrifying, she stands well over ten feet tall, with four arms - two of which are similar to enormous scythes - and six legs. Her face is vaguely human, though the antenna sticking out of her long green hair and the four inhuman eyes on her forehead belay her insectoid nature; she looks like a freakish mix between a human and a mantis.

				Sensing your approach, the monster steps out of the wreckage, tossing aside planks and iron-rimmed wagon wheels with ease. In one scythe-like hand, she holds an unconscious maiden with a belly distended with the unmistakable bulge of late-term pregnancy and clad in ill-fitting clothes ripped from within. The insectile behemoth meets your gaze, and a smile breaks across her face. Placing the woman gently behind her, she unintentionally gives you a good look at her chitinous lower half, complete with a half-dozen skittering legs and a tubular, tail-like extension that sprouts from the back of her abdomen. The backmost foot of it shines with reflective juices. Whether they're her own or her captive's, you cannot say.

				You realize that you’ve seen something like her before; during the time you helped Ophelia, you found the husk of one of her kind. This insectoid being has to be one of the Gol, the fearsome creatures that the alchemist warned you about. Looks like you have no choice but to face this one, however. Looking a live one in the face is a heck of a lot more intimidating than their remains, that’s for sure… and this one looks even bigger than the one you found. No - not just one. You see several others nearby, though much smaller and differently endowed. Perhaps these are drones of some kind.

				“Did you also come to join my hive?” her buzzing voice asks as she lays her victim alongside a number of other, similarly swollen captives. Some are unconscious, but others are awake, softly moaning as their fingers splay across taut, pregnant skin or fluid-drenched fur. Not even the males have escaped her attentions. They lie there with swollen balls and dazed looks on their faces, looking fondly at her while quietly begging for her attention.

				In her other hand, she is grasping what must unmistakably be Lagon’s scepter. It’s a grand thing, crowned by a large gemstone. You tell her in no uncertain terms that you're here for the scepter, not to join her hive - trying to hide your surprise at her words. You thought these creatures were feral? Readying yourself for battle, you prepare to face down the monstrosity.

				The Gol straightens to her full height and turns to answer, splintering wood as each pointed, chitin-plated foot slams into the remains of an unlucky wagon. “A shame.” She climbs closer, batting the eyelashes over her human eyes while four unblinking, insectile eyes stare you down. “I've only learned to enjoy sex as your people do since discovering this scepter.” She holds it aloft in one hand, just below her scything arms. “But it's so much better when you start out unwilling.” Her nippleless breasts heave with excitement. “You shall make a fine ${player.mfFem("incubator", "breeder")} for the hive!”

				The monster waves her scepter, and the men and women are carried away by scurrying drones, off to whatever fate awaits them deeper within the canyon. You're going to have to fight this crazy Gol if you don't want to wind up like the people of the caravan!`);

They broke without much effort.” She snaps her mantis-like claws. “All I had to do was treat them with a degree of tenderness, perhaps expose them to my pollen, and they became willing breeders.”

		You try to crawl away, but she hooks an insectile limb around your ${pc.foot}.

		“Tsk, tsk. Just because you can struggle doesn't mean you won't be useful to my hive.” She spins the scepter in her hand. “Do you think an item such as this - one that gave me the gifts of thought and speech - could be used to bring you into the fold? To make you willingly, eagerly mine?” She skitters forward, dislodging bits of wood as she moves.

		You feebly struggle once, then sag back, defeated and wondering what fresh terrors she's going to inflict upon you.

		The Gol chirps in happiness. “That's more like it. I don't desire your pain, only your compliance.” One of her legs tugs a ragged-looking quilt out from the caravan's rubble, its once fine stitching torn in places. Its fluff has bled out in places, but there is no doubt that it was a well-made blanket. Feeling the comforting softness press against you as you're laid down is a stark relief. “Now, why don't you just forget about your old life and focus on serving me. It'll be easier for you that way.”

		You spit your defiance at her. There is still too much left for you to do!

		She shakes her head sadly. “How petty and simple your goals are. The world does not revolve around you, little meatling. The scepter has helped me see that. It is only by working together in unified purpose that we can make anything good, and who better to guide that purpose than the one who holds the scepter?” Her armored bulk skitters forward.

Just seeing one of those exoskeletal monstrosities coming down next to your head would probably send you into fits. You try your damnedest to quiet the tremors of nervous energy toying with your muscles, but the partial success is little comfort.

		The heat of the insect-woman’s enormous underside washes over you in waves, accompanied by scents both musky and pleasant; all are oddly sexual, spreading twinges of desire through your body under the tight-knit balls of fear.

		“Oh, don’t be afraid. I’d never hurt one of my breeders.”

		You stomach a smarmy reply - there’s no use in getting offed if you can help it. You beg for her to let you go, sincerely doubting that it’ll work.

		As expected, it doesn’t. The monstrous Gol actually giggles. <i>“Oh, still your worrying, pet. All will be made clear enough soon. Here, let me assuage your fears - you seem awfully worried about being stepped on, after all.”</i> Something warm and wet sprays across you, and you can’t hold your eyes shut any longer. You have to see what fresh horror she has brought to the fore.

		“Oh.” The word slips through your lips at the sight of your body covered in sticky, rapidly solidifying webbing. Some of the pointed legs zip back and forth across your body, arranging it before it finishes hardening, then she squirts another wave of the stuff from recessed glands you would have missed at first glance, covering you in so much that everything below your neck obscured by white silk. Well, almost everything. Your crotch has been left curiously unguarded and your ${pc.armor} removed. When did that happen? You feel like you should be struggling, but your head is dizzy from the fight or her scent, and you don’t want to get stepped on. The thickening cocoon is blessedly comfortable as well.

		At some point while your eyes were closed, the insect Matron spun around so that her front was past your feet, and her tail positioned over your head. Now you’re getting your first good look at the odd organ at its tip. It’s a little longer than it was when you first got here, if such a thing is possible, and a small, lubricant dripping hole sits at the end. You don’t know that much about insects, but you wager this is where her eggs come from. Maybe you should be grossed out right now. Instead, you find yourself fascinated by its unique biology.

		Just how big could her eggs be, and why is everyone from the caravan pregnant if she lays eggs? Her tail twitches as if mindful of your gaze, dripping a thicker flow of its fluid onto your bound chest. She must be ready to birth again. The organ surges out another inch or so from the surrounding carapace, gleaming in the starlight. That scent you smelled earlier - the musky, sexual tang that sent shivers down your spine - is stronger now, given off by the swelling ovipositor above.

		You whimper, though from fear or arousal, you cannot tell. The Gol queen is a magnificent piece of work, perfectly engineered to breed often and in large quantities. The dripping hole above is clearly her ovipositor, and it’s stretching out before your very eyes, engorging in preparation of... something. You try to convince yourself the moisture ${player.LowerBodyType() !== LowerBodyType.Single ? "between your thighs" : "in your loins"} is nervous sweat and that the prickle of your sensitive nipples against their bindings is a trick of your mind.

You whine, high pitched and plaintive, looking at her growing ovipositor with a sort of half-understood need. There’s no doubting the thing’s phallic nature now. It isn’t meant to lay eggs; it’s meant to ram into a hot, sweaty box like yours and pump it full of eggs in the most pleasant way possible. A splatter of fragrant lubricant glances off your lip, and you taste it without thinking, savoring the flavor. An idea bursts upon, whole and fully formed, perfect in its majesty - you could let her fill you with eggs and escape while she’s tired.

		It might be a little hard to walk, with your belly all pregnant and dome-like, gleaming and shifting with every egg-weighted step you take, but you could get away, maybe find somewhere quiet to lie down and.... It’s better to leave it a mystery. Maybe you’ll jill yourself off and dig every drop of her delicious nectar from your well-used slit. Maybe you’ll just sit there, rubbing your tummy while the life within you grows to maturity. Maybe you’ll cum just from feeling your beautiful Gol babies slide out into the grass, slick with fluid that smells just as wonderful as their mommy’s.

		A warm, melodious voice cuts through your musings like a blade through butter. Why didn’t you notice how sweet she sounded before? “Is something the matter, dear?” The armored women is looking over her shoulder at you with a look of knowing concern, but the excited flush of her cheeks tell you just how aware of your condition she is. Why, her ovipositor is still growing above you, firming up in preparation of something. She scuttles a short distance away, then turns to face you. “You look... eager. Did you change your mind... about being my incubator?” She pauses, blushing hotter. “I have so many I could give you, again and again.”

		Your mouth waters and your head swims. Your ${pc.vag} feels like a hot spring’s waterfall. The Gol’s ovipositor just looked so thick and... filling. You were going to trick her into... stuffing you full of her eggs so you could get away. Somehow, you get even wetter at the idea.

		Licking your lips, you answer, proud of how deceptively eager you sound, “Yes! Use me as your eggholster!” A decidedly panty-drenching thought occurs to you, and you can’t help but give it voice. “Stuff me so full of eggs you have to web my gaped cunt shut just to hold them in!” That was filthy, but it made your ${pc.vag} weep with anticipation. Maybe she’ll wrap you up in webs and just let you hang there until it’s time for your next filling.

		Her voice cuts your fantasies short once more. “I exist to serve.” Her tone is anything but humble, but how could you care when that thick cunt-stretcher is being pointed in your direction. It’s so close to you now, the clear fluids it exudes painting a trail up the ruined quilt toward the ${player.LowerBodyType() !== LowerBodyType.Single ? "junction of your thighs" : "hole that lies at the center of your body and thoughts"}. The need is palpable, almost all consuming. Your heartbeat hammers so hard you worry that it’ll crack your chest when the Gol’s oozing organ finally makes first contact.

		It feels better than you thought it would - better than a fingertip or penis ever could. Your lips part with glacial slowness around the intruder’s slickened bulk. You can tell she’s going easy on you, much as you might want her to ram it in until it’s splitting your cervix. Even going slow, it feels right in a way that tickles at your synapses, burning away worries and depression more effectively than any celebration or gift.

You feel it’s about to tear you in two and make you cum all at the same time, and then, suddenly, it’s inside you, falling to rest against the soft wall of your womb.

				The egg is so warm. Even buried within you, you can feel it radiating heat. It’s just a hair warmer than your own body, enough to remind you at all times that you’re carrying more than just your own flesh.

				While you marvel at your motherhood, flush with multiple varieties of pleasure, another egg begins its journey inward. Then another, and another... and another. These come easier than the first. Your elasticized pussy has spread so terrifically wide. You doubt a lesser lover could ever please you again. The eggs come on, one after another, slowly filling your uterus with potential life, pressing by sensitive nerves on their way in.

				The eighth egg has you cumming and screaming your devotion to the Queen. The body-wracking ecstasy goes on for so long that you lose count of just how many eggs slip inside, but the number doesn’t really matter, so long as you’re full of her blessings. Drool runs from the corner of your open, moaning mouth, but that doesn’t matter either. Your life as an incubator doesn’t matter. Being gaped by an insect woman doesn’t matter.

				Being the best possible egg-bearer is what matters. That, and cumming as often as possible while doing so.

				Your belly bulges. Your pussy creams. You cum, and cum, and cum until unconsciousness claims you.`);

		Text.Out(`Gingerly, the Gol lowers herself down onto you, pinning you under her soft underside. It's less uncomfortable than you would think, but it does put you in the unfortunate position of having her fragrant gash positioned a few inches above your face.

		She wiggles, getting comfortable, and in the process rubbing your uncomfortably hard penis between your bodies. Dragging the scepter's head around her engorging folds, the feminine creature promises, “You're going to get very acquainted with this hole soon.” She brings it up to do tiny circuits around a very prominent clitoris. “The males from the caravan were quite taken with it. I believe their exact words were that it was entrancing.”

		Entrancing? You don't really see it. Sure, it's a huge, fertile-looking pussy with puffy, wet lips that would feel so good to slip inside of it, but you wouldn't really call it entrancing. It's just a pussy. A nice-looking example of feminine genitalia, but nothing more.

		“There you go, staring at it like it's the most important thing in the world. If you aren't careful, you're going to want to fuck it more than anything - more than having free will.” The Gol playfully strokes your hair.

		Yeah, right. You ignore her condescending petting. You could look somewhere else if you wanted. There's nothing stopping you. It's just... just that it's her most interesting feature - the best part of her for sure. The smell of it is even kind of pleasant in its way. You squirm a little, feeling more than a little hot, but that's only because she's pinning it down and making you look at her fuckable cunt. It's a perfectly normal reaction. A droplet of lubrication falls on your cheek, making you wonder just what it would taste like.

		Giggling excitedly, the Gol drags the scepter across her increasingly wet womanhood once more. Her lips briefly part, revealing a flash of its insides so pink that you could swear it burns an afterimage into your retinas. “It's okay if you don't look away. That's what I want, after all. Do you want me to hold it open so that you can see it better?” From the corner of your vision, you see her cock her head questioningly.

		When a sexy girl asks you if you want to see the inside of her pussy, you don't say no. “Yes...” Your ${pc.cocks} surge${c.notS} excitedly at the prospect. Damn, you're really, really hard. She doesn't have any kind of magic vagina powers or anything, she's just really hot, wet, and smells like bottled sex. Your ${pc.cocks} strains${c.notS} inside your ${pc.armor}. You'd have to be castrated not to want a slit like that. “Please?”

		The Gol says something, but you're too busy watching her fingers hook into her sides of her dribbling delta and pull it wide opening, revealing the wettest, slickest looking pussy you've ever laid eyes on it. And it's just so... so... <i>pink</i>.

		You breathe deeply and sigh in delight. Her scent smells even more potent now - practically all-consuming. The air itself seems stained with her incredibly feminine flavor. Perhaps it's from how wet she's gotten? You thrill at the knowledge that she's lubricating for you, making herself ready for you to fuck her. If only you hadn't tried to fight her, you could be fucking <i>right now</i>. You groan and twist beneath her, rubbing your dick against her supple underbelly. Your eyes longingly trace the contours of her interior, and your mouth falls open, hoping to catch one of the glistening droplets that are falling over your ${pc.face}.

		The Gol dips a finger inside, gathering some of her juices up. “Do you want a taste?” She giggles. “Once you try it, you'll never want another woman again. You'll be hooked on my pussy.”

		It's enough to make you chuckle. “Just because I'd be eating you out if I could doesn't mean I'm going to follow you around, worshipping it all day long.” You smirk, then open wide. “Go on, let me have a taste so we can stop this silly game and get to the fucking.”

		“Now that's the kind of eagerness I like to hear from my drones!” The Gol puts her gooey finger on your lip. Her hand blocks your view of her entrance, but that's just fine, you figure. The view would just distract you from the taste. Closing your eyes, you suck her proffered digit into your maw and run your tongue over it, licking her flavorful juices from her knuckle. She tastes like... peaches and cherries mixed together? You pause momentarily, then flick your tongue around the finger, gathering her ambrosia from every nook and cranny. You hum softly as you work, suckling her to the knuckle.

		Even when there's nothing left but your own saliva, you can still feel the taste on your tongue, in your throat, and in your belly. It suffuses your body, fills you with a tingling, bubbling kind of sexual excitement. Here you are, pinned down by this sexy creature, and you can't even use your mouth to please her, let alone your wildly pulsating, dribbling dick. If you put it inside right now, you'd probably cum on the spot. But that's fine. You'd just have to keep fucking her until you could cum a second time. Somehow you know you'd have quite a few wombs to fill.

		Pulling her finger out, the Gol looks between you and her spit-glossed digit. “Well, what do you think, drone? Isn't it a pussy worth worshipping?”

		You lick your lips in an effort to gather every stray mote of flavor into your maw, eyes shining brightly as they openly stare at the alien gash. “It's, uh... pretty good. Scoot forward, would you? Please?”

		The Gol edges her scuttling form forward just enough to press the bottom of her oversized slit against your chin. Strings of her sticky, feminine syrup fall over your face. Heedless of how slick your face is getting, you lean up and press yourself against her, finally getting to touch your tongue directly to this sexy monster-woman's entrance. A shiver wracks your pinned body, and your cock's need explodes from a quiet simmer to a rolling boil. You grunt in ecstasy, muffled by the thick, fertile folds of the mantis-girl's heavenly slit. Cum bubbles out of your ${pc.cocks} in thick squirts, your dick harder than its ever felt before.`);

You know you were impassioned about proving something to her just a minute ago, but it seems small and unimportant next to the need to flood her delightful honeypot with fertile seed. You rub your palms along her chitinous sides. She'd feel so good swollen with your eggs. If only she'd let you inside! “Please, Queen!”

		You don't know why you called her that, but it felt... right somehow. The powerful, regal creature looms large in stature, both above and in your mind. She deserves to be worshipped.

Your eyes cross to watch it. “What indeed.”

		You lick your lips, whimpering. Belatedly, you remember that your Queen expects a response. “Why would I run with you right here?” You tip your head back and open your mouth hungrily, hoping she'll press that droplet to your tongue.
