* Increased the timespan when Layla could be encountered to 8-18.
* Fixed a Bull Tower bug that would cause the ending to loop, resulting in all kinds of weirdness.
* Increased the suspicion gain from moving about in Bull Tower, making it more difficult to get away clean. Perfect run should be 60 suspicion.
* Increased the lust gain from Corishev's whip.

Version 0.4a
------------
* The Bull Tower: Huge new dungeon, in the style of Krawitz quest. Written by The Observer.
 - Get at least 60 rel with Cveta at the Outlaws (need to meet with her dawn and dusk a few times to get past the initial barrier), then enter the Outlaw camp

* Fixed a bug in some characters' leveling pace.

* Layla added to farm. You need to defeat Orchid before you can meet her.
 - If you choose to take her, you can return after three days. If you don't, she's not intended to disappear, but right now she has no content on the farm.
 - Once you pick her up, she only has very basic follower interactions, including a huge first-time sex and a repeatable sex scene.
* Mothgirl oral now correctly gives xp and lust reduction.
* Fixed some erroneus hip descriptors.

Version 0.3x2
-------------
* Fixed a bug in Zebra shaman encounter.
* Terry's pet option now has a back button.
* Terry now has a lick pussy sex option (should help out with that soft lock problem) written by LD & QB.

Version 0.3x
------------
* Zebra shaman encounter added to highlands, written by Bluebusterman. Current scenes:
 - Win, Fuck him
* Completely refactored out use of old Text.AddOutput and Text.Newline. It's possible that this might have some adverse effects. Holler if there are suddenly blank screens or missing text somewhere.

* Fixed a bug that would break talking to Lagon when you had sided with him.

 - No followup currently
 - No judgement for Lagon currently
* Lagon scenes added, a total of 15k words written by me:
 - Talk scenes

* Added several Save locations:
 - Outlaws camp
 - Dryad's glade

Version 0.3v2
-------------
* Fixed a bug in Terry save format

Version 0.3v
------------
* Fixed a bug in Terry vag scene.

 - A new loss scene for the female.

* Restructured the end of combat so the Defeat/Win screen with exp and loot always shows up first. Report if there are fights that don't behave this way (or are suddenly acting odd).
* Restructured how capacity and stretch works. Still pending some balance. The values have been set on a different scale, and scenes lockouts should now only be based on cock thickness (not length). There may still be some weirdness. Saves have been tweaked for player, kiakai and rosalin.
* Added mastery skills for all the implemented jobs. These are only unlocked after you reach master level.
* Rebalanced Bruiser (skills, bonuses). It's now more of a strength based job, rather than a tanky one. Provoke has been moved to Fighter.

* You can now leave the Mothgirl battle without playing a sex scene.

Version 0.3t
------------
* The search for the scepter is on! Includes about 10k words worth of scenes written by Fenoxo. The Gol has two loss scenes and three win scenes.

* Added TFs to Terry. This doesn't quite work the same way as usual TFs, but look around and I'm sure you'll figure out how to do it.

* Fixed a but in Kiakai's anal catch scene.
* Tweaked the output of Cavalcade a bit.
* Better pics for Kiakai.

* Fixed a variety of small bugs, parser errors and typos reported through the gdocs form and github. Keep em coming!
* Terry's introduction scenes. I'd suggest you replay the mansion heist to get the most of this (old saves may be slightly weird). Terry is written by LukaDoc and QuietBrowser.
* Rigard brothel is now... there. Not quite open for business yet.
* Fixed tons of bugs and inconsistencies courtesy of trixymoon on github. Thanks a lot!
* Changed how the party switching system works. You can now only switch party members in specific areas. Currently, the party hang out around the campfire in the Nomads' camp when not on duty. Notice the green explore button! This change should also be reflected in scenes that involve other party members (they variations will only trigger if the follower is in your active party).
* Three new dreams added.
* A reworking of the item system. Not noticable so far, but it will allow use of certain items in combat later on. Terry has a few of them.

* Fera should now be able to take your second cock if your first one is too big.

* New Gwendy sequence, that will allow you to enter Rigard (talk with her about it, and be sure to be an early bird). Oneshot for the moment, but it is planned to be repeatable.

 - Gates interactions
 - Hateful love: A legit way of getting into Rigard (requiring you to become a complete slut)
 - Dating: Another legit way of getting into Rigard (only some times requiring you to become a complete slut)

Version 0.3f2
-------------
* Fixed a bug with disabled buttons not rendering properly.
* Removed text selections on the buttons (it is still technically possible, but not by pressing/dragging on the buttons)
* Changed the default button font to Impact and added a black outline for readability.
* Known GUI bugs:
 - Toggle pictures option doesn't do anything.
 - Toggle key shortcuts doesn't do anything.

Version 0.3f

Version 0.3e
------------

* Fixed bug in Lizard anal scene (FINALLY found it, the new debug thing rocks!)
* Added mothgirl and wolf enemies to the forest (no scenes for them yet)
* Added a scorpion girl enemy to the desert (no scenes for her yet). She ought to be rather tough, and can poison you.
* Added a status effect spell, venom, that deals damage over time. For the time being, it is added to the Scholar job (cannot be learnt).
* Added a status effect, burn, that deals damage over time. For the time being it is a random effect of the fireball spell.
* Added a status effect, freeze, that randomly slows you down. For the time being it is a random effect of the Freeze spell.
* Added a status effect, numb, that randomly stuns you. For the time being it is a random effect of the Bolt spell.
* Added Magnus the mage ("Scholar") to the camp. With his help, you may be able to unlock new powers within you.
* Added the mage job (needs to be unlocked). The text mentions the Mystic and Healer jobs, those will also be unlocked once I've made their abilities.

Version 0.3c
------------
* Minor tweaks and bug fixes
* Character job levels now shows correctly when you have maxed out the job.
* New Gwendy challenge win scenes: Blowjob/Cunnilingus/Vag fuck/Trib/Anal/Various toy scenes.
 - The strapon scenes are not written yet and will be added later.
 - The D.Dildo scene might not be possible to trigger right now, as it needs you to increase your butt capacity.
* Added a new farm work scene (talk to gwendy->work) where you see Danie again. It is pretty innocent.
* A few scenes for Miranda added:
 - There is a minor one-time event you can find during the daytime, exploring the streets of Rigard (various areas).
 - There is a two part one-time event at the tavern the maidens' bane, located in the slums outside Rigard.
 - There is a repeatable chat scene with Miranda after the initial scenes, but it is little more than a placeholder right now.
* Added bug catcher for scenes. Sorta.
 - When the game gets a runtime error, you'll get a popup with some info. Mail this to me and I'll fix it as quickly as possible.
 - The game tries to continue on if possible. If it was parser related, the harmful piece of text will show up in red. Send this as well.
 - While not perfect, it will help me see what problems are actually occuring and fix them instead of trying to reproduce them.

Version 0.3b
------------
* Fixed debug mode bug
* For now, removed repeat loss abductions by rabbits (until I make a proper repeat scene)
* Lust gain over time, both in and out of combat.
* Cum and milk gain over time added (not finished).
* Job level added to portrait (level/sexlevel/joblevel). Will show a * when the job is maxed out.
* Job description added to job selection prompt.
* Kiai can now access the standard starter jobs (though they are tough to level).
* A slew of other assorted bugs and typos.
* Hopefully squashed the initiative bug. For those playing on IE (only place it seems to show up), please holler if you are still seeing characters going into negative initiative.
* Fixed an annoying bug with the starter job in the save format. Unfortunately this means that everyones saves will default to fighter (don't worry, it has no long term impact except the slight xp bonus to that one job). Starting a new character (or loading an older save which lets you pick) sets the save correctly.

Version 0.3a
------------
* Cavalcade pictures, drawn by Jass Befrold, colored by me. Hopefully this enables you to visualize your hand quickly.
* Updated credits screen a bit.
* Intro to Burrows added (Fight the rabbits at the crossroads to get it). Followup in progress.
* A fantasize option added to the players party options, to quickly raise your lust. Intended to have dreamlike sequences later.
* Added more black magic spells, based on a new system of elemental damage.
* Added a whole lot of physical and supportive abilities, rewrote the ones already implemented.
* Cleaned up the way abilities are presented in combat. There are now 4 static categories that are always in the same position:
 - Skills (physical abilities)
 - Spells (attack magic)
 - Support (healing magic, buffs etc)
 - Seduce (lust based abilities)
* Added and refined starter body types (the buttons actually do something now!)
* New job system used to learn abilities. Still a work in progress. Ask the chief about how it works.
* Some minor changes to the intro, involving starting job and equipment. If you load an old game, you will get the same perks.
* Added an aggro system. The abilities Charm, Allure, Provoke and Taunt can tweak how enemies attack you. Only Charm is available for use atm (Courtesan job).
* A whole slew of gear added, currently only available through the starter job choice.

Version 0.2z
------------
* Minor bugfixes and typos
* New Gwendy challenge win scenes: Handjob/Frig/Titjob/Tease
* New Gwendy challenge loss scenes: Make-out
* Added one really complex and strange scene to the daytime merchants' street in Rigard. (X)plore the area between 6 and 18 to get it. There are so many variations to it that some parser error might have slipped through, so report if you find anything.

Version 0.2y
------------
* Fixed a bunch of bugs in the new scene for Kiakai.
* Fixed a bunch of lizard related bugs.
* Changed the way virginities are tracked, since there seems to be some trouble with how it is currently tracked. Sadly, this kind of breaks a few things, so if you were a virgin, you likely aren't anymore.
* To somewhat address the above point, a new option is added to the cocksmith/elfcalibrator to reset your virginity. There are still a few NPCs that currently track virginities that will likely be deflowered until you start a new game (or saveedit, check for virgin entries in the file, put 1 for virgin, 0 for deflowered).
* A new Kiakai sex scene has been added.
* The initial scenes for a character named Lei has been added (not 100% finished, so you may come across placeholders). He can be found in the plaza inn in Rigard (Debug mode).
* Added equippable sex toys (can only be obtained by cheating atm). At the moment, they only work with Kiakai's sex scenes, and nothing else. Test equipping one of them on a female character (or on female Kia) and it should open up new scenes. If you have a real cock, it will automatically use that for the scene (though there is no real reason the opposite can't be used in some scenes).

Version 0.2x
-------------
* A new, very extensive and much anticipated scene for Kiakai. It requires some unlocking. The reverse scene will probably come next week, it hasn't been fully written yet.

[SPOILER]: First, you need to do the healing sex multiple times. Eventually, "Sex" will become an option in the interact menu. Pick it, you then need to unlock the scene by talking with him/her (Talk->Priesthood->Diciplines->Confront). Now you can unlock the actual scene by picking Sex again. Only pitch is actually implemented.

Version 0.2w2
-------------
* Bugfix: Rosalin Equinium is no longer bugged for female Rosalin.
* Bugfix: Cavalcade draw no longer hangs the game.

Version 0.2w
------------
* Balanced the intro fight more to your advantage (after the stats revamp, the demon got his turn way too often).
* Restructured TF item backend (should have fixed a bunch of inconsitent TF effects in the process, may have introduced new bugs).
* Added several random NPC chatter scenes you will get when walking/exploring the streets of Rigard.
* Lizards win scenes. Not 100% finished quite yet, females should have at least one more scene. The female lizard has one "hidden" scene, that require you to grind to sex level 3. More delicious lizard sex from Salrith!
* Added human and avian TF items (cheat).
* Added a cock worship scene for Rosalin, written by Fenoxo!
* Added a new dommy 69 scene for Kiakai, with multiple options (other than minor touch-ups, this concludes the tier 1 Kiai content).
* Added the cardgame Cavalcade (can be played at the campfire). Later updates will add visual representations of the cards, making it easier to evaluate your hand at a glance.

Version 0.2v
------------
* Typos etc.
* Fixed save bug that would mess up horns/tails
* Added a demon TF, dog TF, fox TF and wolf TF. Can currently not be found/made in the game (see next point).
* Added a debug option in the tent called ITEM. It will give you one of every item currently in the game. Cheater.
* Added a dominant cunnilingus scene for Kiakai.
* Updated the breast and butt descriptions to be more correct.

Version 0.2u
------------
* Cheat menu for Kiakai added in debug mode, in the tent.
* Kia/Kia seduce scene finished (the female variations)
* Some new dialog scenes for Rosalin, talking about her past

Version 0.2t2
-------------
* Clear saves now has a confirm button.
* Pleasure Kia bug fixed.
* Minor typo fixes.

Version 0.2t
------------
* Bovia fix.
* You can't sell grass for free monies anymore (I set the "value" of the item to zero, and made shops not show the option to sell value-less items).
* Miranda the dog-morph basic encounter added to Rigard (going to the gates now possible outside of Debug mode). Going inside the city still requires Debug mode. Miranda currently has no followup.
* Sex scenes for Fera the catgirl added (need Debug mode to enter the city).
* A slightly incomplete nice healing scene for Kiakai added. In reality it is like 6 scenes, but the variations for female Kia is missing. I'll try to write those for next week's update.

Version 0.2s
------------
* Minor bugfixes (Bovia should drop correctly when the game indicates it should in Gwendy's scene)
* Kiakai got a new, slightly longer cuddle scene, courtesy to Del.
* You can now help Gwendy both in the barn and fields area (same scenes, different time of day).
* Gwendy's first challenge won/lost scenes are coded (courtesy of Kiro). Much more to come.
* If you for some reason want to pick grass on the fields at the farm, you now can.
* If you manage to find all the ingredients, you can have Rosalin create the Bovia potion.
* 2 random Rigard scenes written by Del added (still locked behind a debug barrier). Go to the plaza and explore if you are interested.
* The Silken Delights clothing store in Rigard (written by Resar) is starting to take form. Some basic talky scenes are in place (much more to come).

Version 0.2r
-------------
* Fixed various bugs: Combat initiative bug in IE should hopefully be fixed.

Content:
* The scene you get when pumping Rosalin full of Equinium now has a followup (still pretty unfinished).
* Gwendy is starting to make her presence known on the farm. Expect a lot of placeholder text. If you get lucky, you can recieve a new TF item.
* Linked in the city of Rigard (only available in debug mode, and highly unfinished). If you want, you can run around there and look around. Don't make any bug reports regarding Miranda, her content is going to be rewritten (this is oooold stuff).

Note on playability: running the game on IE offline won't work (even if you allow for ActiveX controls to run). This is due to IE's policy on localstorage, and isn't something I know how to fix (even if I fixed the particular problem causing it to crash, you wouldn't be able to save). Get a better browser or play online.

Version 0.2q2
-------------
* Fixed various bugs: Rosalin repeat equinium scene works. Fight with Maria works. Party exp bug fixed.

Version 0.2q
------------
* Changed the damage formula, might still be very unbalanced.
* You can now switch characters in and out (player is always part of active party). Companions in the reserve will not participate in combat (or post combat scenes). Specific scene depending on a character being there (such as when showing Rosalin the gem) will still trigger, even if the character is in the reserve. Characters in the reserve still receive combat exp (though slightly less).
* Changed the way leveling works. Might be a bit obtuse, I'll explain later.
* Fixed errors in the new Blowjob scene.
* Fixed minor bug regarding debug mode.
* Fixed some wonkyness in the GUI I caused trying to reenable screen reader stuff last week.
* Changed how arms and legs are tracked. This might have left some bugs in the code, so report if things are acting wonky.

Content:
* Added a new encounter in the forest. Explore and find out (between 6-20)! You might get beaten up if you haven't leveled up though... There is currently no followup to this content.
* Added some fun scenes for Rosalin (also, learn more alchemy!). To get the new scenes, get some ingredients and ask her to combine them. There is a special scene if you stock up on horse stuff and get lucky. There is currently only one implemented scene for sex for the alchemist, more coming later.

Version 0.2p
------------
* Put explore and people in the same tab
* Fixed save-restores-all-health (on a totally unrelated note, toggling debug no longer gives you full hp. Can't have everything)
* Seduce scenes are now available at full health too (with a slightly different introduction scene)
* One new scene for Kiakai: Assertive blowjob. There is a variation for longer cocks (>20cm)
* Changing cock length and thickness is now available at cocksmith in debug mode

Version 0.2o
------------
* Added some new healing scenes for KiaKai (seduce->eat out)
* Fixed a save bug that was breaking save to file in previous version
* Removed the ability for the screen to overflow (restricting the page size to the canvas).

Combat stuff:
* Changed combat calculations (still needs a lot of balancing)
* Added hit/miss for physical attacks
* Reduced the effectiveness of lust attacks
* Removed the loss-by-lust, lust is used as combat resource for powerful attacks instead

Added four special attacks:
* Bash - Hits for slightly higher damage, stuns enemy. Lower accuracy
* Pinpoint - Hits for higher damage, with higher accuracy
* Pierce - Hits an enemy's weak point, ignoring part of their defense
* D.Attack - Attacks an enemy twice, with lower hit chance (two separate hits)
All attacks drain your SP. The player has all four for now, and I gave one of each to each of the enemy types

Added four attack spells:
* Erupt - Fireball, focuses on raw magical power
* Freeze - Ice, focuses on piercing enemy defense
* Shock - Thunder, slightly weaker, but adds a small stun effect
* Hellfire - Hits all enemies for massive damage (slightly less serious, as it is horribly OP atm)
Player starts with all

Added two defensive spells:
* Toughen - Increases stamina of one character (effect resets after combat. Does not stack)
* Empower - Increases stength of one character (effect resets after combat. Does not stack)
Kiakai has them

Added some lust based attacks (targets hp, uses lp as resource):
* Rut - Deals damage for a small lust cost
* Fantasize - raises own lust
Player has both

Version 0.2n
------------
* Bug fixes
* Removed the thing blocking CTRL+C etc. The reason for it was that some people reported that keyboard shortcuts were disabled (somehow some search function was enabling instead). Report if you have any problems like that.
* Added hidden text fields behind buttons. Screen readers, let me know how that works! One problem is that the Data, Explore etc buttons will probably always show up (on screen readers).
Debugging stuff:
* Added debug printouts for stat gains
* Added debug printouts for item gain/loss
* Added debug printouts for relationship scores
* Added a debug shop to the tent, where you can modify your body
* Added introductory scenes to Rosalin the alchemist, including a quest ending in you being able to do alchemy on your own.
* Hopefully fixed the bug that made saves prior to version 0.2m unable to save again.
* Implemented sexual experience gain. If you activate debug mode, you can see exp/sexp gain. Gaining sex levels does nothing atm. If you find a scene (there are many) where the player doesn't gain any sexp (and you think they should), report it!
* Added a lizard TF item, and associated ingredient drops.
* Restructured the way flags are stored in the save format. Hopefully didn't break anything.

Version 0.2m2
-------------
* Bug fixes in Kiakai content
* Fixed a bug where the Data option would be available in party interaction scenes.

Version 0.2m
------------
GUI stuff:
* The keyboard shortcut hints can be toggled (the setting is saved between sessions)
* Added a keyboard shortcut for the Data menu
* Added tooltips to the Wait, Sleep and Explore (looking glass) buttons

* Added Gwendy's farm (written by Kiro) (can be found while exploring the plains between 7 and 17): About 11k words worth of scenes, including some sex.
* Added Lizard loss scenes (written by Salrith): About 10k words worth of scenes. Pretty damn hot.
* Kiakai has a bunch of new talky scenes. The old stuff should move on a rotation now, so you can get all the info in a timely manner instead of holding out for random scenes.
* Kiakai has a bunch of healing scenes reachable from his/her menu. They are unfinished, so for now you need a cock to get the most of it. You get different scenes depending on your current health.

* Changed the way initiative works, which should make dex less overpowered. Basically, the higher your DEX and INT is, the more often you can attack (though it doesn't scale the same as before).

* Now supports IE10. Possibly supports IE prior to 10 (not tested). WILL NOT WORK OFFLINE.

Version 0.2l
------------
* Implemented a speed fix that should really help for people who have been complaining about 100% CPU usage.

* Added dialogue and more detailed text to the nomad camp, and the camp chief.
* Added another prototype NPC, Estevan the satyr hunter (not implemented yet)
* Added some dialogue for Kia/Kai
* Added loss scenes for the equine encounters
* Added a new mob, the lizard, to the desert
* To make it easier to view loss scenes, I added a submit button to combat
* To make it easier to view win scenes, I added a cheat button to combat (only in debug mode)

* Added saving to file using a php backend (will only work with the online version)
* Added loading from file (works both off- and online)

* Toggle to remove avatars/pictures

* Removed the fight/wait/sleep options. They are replaced by icons to the left of the regular options. Wait/Sleep are tied to 'Z', explore/search is tied to 'X'
* Added a tiny letter for keyboard shortcut to buttons that have them

* Added tail and ears TF to current items
* As a temporary measure, made 100% lust incapacitating. This will probably change down the line when I figure out what to do with it.

Version 0.2k3
-------------
* There is now two different portraits for the main character, one male and one female. Both are kind of ambiguous. This will have to do until I implement a proper CV style portrait.
* Debug button in credits/data that adds 50 to all stats, allowing you to maul pretty much anything. Debug also reduces the cost of all items to zero.
* Fixed bird bug
* Fix starting stats (cock length starts at 15cm)
* TF framework is slightly changed. It should no longer be possible to get negative cock length from overuse of leporine, for example.
* Imps no longer lose their virginity all the time.
* A growth stat added. Old saves will have a new oppurtunity to apply Uru's gift that includes this. When a stat has a higher growth, each stat point added will increase it slightly more (2points -> +3 instead of +2)

* Fixed a clitCock save format bug. If you started as a herm you may need to restart your character for everything to work as intended.
* Fixed a bug in the save format with the weight/height.

* Made the UI slightly more tightly packed and reduced the resolution. The game should now be playable on a 1280x720 screen without getting any scrollbars. Tested in fullscreen mode in Firefox and Chrome.
* The UI move-around allows for showing up to five party members and enemies at once. Larger party!
* Two new background colors added: Light (low opacity) and None (no solid bg color). It is also possible to set a custom color.
* Added ability to set a custom font/font size

* Slightly improved appearance screen (now applies to Kia/Kai too)

Version 0.2k2
-------------
* Data menu should be disabled during events!
* Uru should no longer be referred to as a virgin in her scenes
* Added another save point in the "Garden" area during the intro, if you want to replay Kia's initial scenes or make a different choice during the outset.
* A popup prompts you when overwriting old saves
* Selectable bg color (can be found on the credits screen and in the Data menu). This setting is saved.
* Removed the previously "grayed out" options when selecting dead enemies in combat, unusable items in the inventory etc.

------------

* Items drop from enemies
* Inventory added. Loads/saves.
* Shopkeeper "Patchwork" added under People at the Nomad fireplace

 - When the imp fight during the intro is over (win or lose), you can interact with the imps (under the People tab). There is about 4500 words of scenes in total, depending on gender.
 - When either of the imp scenes are finished, the demon will offer to "sexually improve" your body. You can use this gift up to 3 times.
